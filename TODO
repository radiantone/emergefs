- Add different RPC implementations e.g. HTTP (in addition to 0MQ/ZRPC) so it can run in a browser (clients)
- Be able to combine objects into new mixed-in objects
    - For example:  $ emerge mixin /path/object1 /path/object2 /path/mixedobject
    - The state from each source object and its methods are carried over into the new object, leaving the originals in tact
- Stress, performance tests
- pytests
- docs
